# udacity-frontend-project-neighborhood

The solution to the Udacity Neighborhood project. We use Sydney Opera House as our chosen location.

## Instructions

- Go to https://shamim-ahmed.github.io/index.html
- You will see a map of Sydney on the right and a list of locations on the left.
- There is a marker on the map corresponding to each location in the list.
- The user can use the application in two ways:
--* She can click on one of the location names in the list
--* She can click on one of the markers on the map
- In both cases, an info window will open on the corresponding marker that will display relevant information for that location.
- The info window will contain the following data related to the location:
..* An image
..* The name of the location
..* The full Address
..* Category (e.g. monument, church, restaurant)
..* Review
- The image is fetched from Google Street View API
- All the other info is fetched from FourSquare API
