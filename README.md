# udacity-frontend-project-neighborhood

The solution to the Udacity Neighborhood project. We use Sydney Opera House as our chosen location.

## Instructions

- Go to https://shamim-ahmed.github.io/index.html
- You will see a map of Sydney on the right and a list of locations on the left.
- There is a marker on the map corresponding to each location in the list.
- The user can use the application in two ways:
  1. She can click on one of the location names in the list.
  2. She can click on one of the markers on the map.
- In both cases, an info window will open on the corresponding marker that will display relevant information for that location.
- There is a search box above the list of locations on the left side.
- The locations displayed in the list (and the markers on the map) are filtered based on the input in the search box.
- The info window will contain the following data related to the location:
  1. An image.
  2. The name of the location.
  3. The full Address.
  4. Category (e.g. monument, church, restaurant).
  5. Review.
- The image is fetched from Google Street View API.
- All the other info is fetched from FourSquare API.
- For devices with small screens, a hamburger icon appears at the top left corner.
- Clicking on the hamburger icon will show/hide the list containing the location names.
